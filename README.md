# PC-Volume-Control
A small web service for controlling of the volume and default playback device of the hosting machine.

This application uses Nancy for providing the HTTP endpoint and managing authentication. 

The UI is made using a modified forked of the ng-knob AngularJS directive developed by RadMie. The original repo can be found here https://github.com/RadMie/ng-knob and my fork used in this project can be found here https://github.com/EwneoN/ng-knob.

The Audio library is a library I have made using a few different pieces of code that I found when I was serching on how to control Windows audio devices with C#. More information on this library can be found here https://github.com/EwneoN/PC-Volume-Control/tree/master/Audio.
