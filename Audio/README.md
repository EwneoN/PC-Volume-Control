# Audio
A library exposing methods that allows callers to get or set volume, get or set the default playback device and get all audio devices using Win API calls.

This is poorly documented as it is not all my code. I have only slightly modified some parts to improve readability, meet some requirement not already met or to simply get things to build.

A C++ dll is included for which I do have the code, it is just not a part of this repo yet. If required it can be provided.
